This example is obsolete. The [Web Document Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/401850/web-reporting/web-document-viewer) caches documents and reports out of the box. Refer to the following documentation topic for information on caching in the DevExpress Web Document Viewer: [Document Viewer Lifecycle](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/401587/web-reporting/general-information-on-web-reporting/document-viewer-lifecycle#caching-mechanisms)
